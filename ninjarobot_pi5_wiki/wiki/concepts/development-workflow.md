# Development and documentation workflow

Before significant development, consult the local wiki and current full
manuals, inspect relevant code, and identify missing or conflicting evidence.
The root project policy requires an approved phased plan and preservation of
robot interfaces and managed-driver rules.[^src-20260913-developmentguide]

Feature completion includes a wiki impact assessment. Update affected manual
versions, topic pages, specifications, and architecture guidance, then record
the change and validation in the development log. If no documentation change is
needed, record a specific reason. A new source version preserves the old source;
current navigation and the knowledge map identify the active version.[^src-20260907-knowledgeintegration]

Use the project's maintenance guide outside the knowledge bundle for exact
commands. Prepare a semantic page plan, validate it, show the actual diff, and
apply the approved plan with the wiki CLI. Review source support honestly and
check current pointers, file fingerprints, links, indexes, and review coverage.
AI review is distinct from human verification.[^src-20260907-knowledgeintegration]

## Milestones and source consolidation

The active manuals are versioned under `raw/articles/ninjarobotpi5/2026-09-13-03/`
and `raw/notes/ninjarobotpi5/2026-09-13-03/`. This version consolidates:
1. System clock access (`/time` and `system.time.get`, registered from `2026-09-12-02`),
2. Refinement Phase 5 software foundations and distance game (`2026-09-13`),
3. Narrowed Phase 4 foundations (M03 memory ranking, M04 read-only recipes, X01 v2 skills, X05 help, `2026-09-13-02`), and
4. Completed Phase 4 information assistant (T04 calendar, T05 research, T06 notes/checklists/briefings, `2026-09-13-03`).[^src-20260913-developmentguide]

Automated validation covers extensive unit tests, compilation, linting, formatting,
type checks, and driver verification gates. Passing software gates does not
substitute for owner physical acceptance testing on real hardware with raised wheels.[^src-20260913-developmentguide]
