# NinjaRobotPi5 project overview

NinjaRobotPi5 documents an Agent layer for user/model interaction, an IDE layer
for coordinating devices, and managed Pi5 libraries for individual devices.
The development guide describes their permitted ownership boundary.[^src-20260906-developmentguide]

The local wiki is the primary developer knowledge collection. Full manuals are
versioned under raw source folders; outer README links and the project knowledge
map identify the current versions. Read source records and limitations, then
compare important claims with the current checkout before coding.[^src-20260906-knowledgeintegration]
