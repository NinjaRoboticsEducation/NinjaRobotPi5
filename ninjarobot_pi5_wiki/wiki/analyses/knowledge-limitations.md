# Knowledge limitations and verification

Keyword search covers curated pages rather than all raw manual text. It does not
follow citations for the caller. Try focused terms, read the overview, and open
full sources. Search expiry flags, source fingerprints, and semantic review
status are separate signals and must be checked together.[^src-20260907-knowledgeintegration]

A missing result is an evidence gap, not proof a feature is absent. A page can be
structurally valid while its explanation needs review. Current implementation
fingerprints identify files needing knowledge review but cannot prove that prose
is correct. AI-reviewed pages are not human-verified or hardware-tested pages.
Editor adapters need actual session activation checks; a wiki-only workspace may
not expose parent robot code.[^src-20260907-knowledgeintegration]

The development guide's older quality-gate example uses narrower lint paths than
the current root policy. Follow the root operating policy for the current full
checks, and preserve the source's historical context rather than silently treating
an older example as the complete current gate.[^src-20260906-developmentguide][^src-20260907-knowledgeintegration]
