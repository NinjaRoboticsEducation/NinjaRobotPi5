  - Reviewed this page against registered 18 September UI refinement, modular web
    frontend, and terminal menu consolidation evidence; no human verification is claimed.
  - Checkpoint claims distinguish software tests from physical hardware acceptance
    and note pending font repair, monetary spending cap, and physical mobile Wi-Fi
    checks.

# Knowledge limitations and verification

Keyword search covers curated pages rather than all raw manual text. It does not
follow citations for the caller. Try focused terms, read the overview, and open
full sources. Search expiry flags, source fingerprints, and semantic review
status are separate signals and must be checked together.[^src-20260907-knowledgeintegration]

A missing result is an evidence gap, not proof a feature is absent. A page can be
structurally valid while its explanation needs review. Current implementation
fingerprints identify files needing knowledge review but cannot prove that prose
is correct. AI-reviewed pages are not human-verified or hardware-tested pages.
Editor adapters need actual session activation checks; a wiki-only workspace may
not expose parent robot code.[^src-20260907-knowledgeintegration]

The development guide's older quality-gate example uses narrower lint paths than
the current root policy. Follow the root operating policy for the current full
checks, and preserve the source's historical context rather than silently treating
an older example as the complete current gate.[^src-20260918-developmentguide][^src-20260907-knowledgeintegration]

## Limits of recent checkpoints (Phase 4, Phase 5, Calendar, and UI refinement)

The current manual checkpoint (`2026-09-18`) consolidates system time access,
Phase 4 information work, 15–16 September distance game/servo repairs, 17 September
Google Calendar setup and unified CONFIRM flow, and 18 September UI refinement. Software validation is not physical acceptance:[^src-20260918-developmentguide]
- **Web interface refinement & IDE menu**: UI components, websocket event messaging, user-behavior execution modals, and terminal menu consolidation have passed 125 automated unit tests and mock validations; physical acceptance on mobile devices over real Wi-Fi networks and touch-screen D-pad latency require live operator verification.[^src-20260918-developmentguide]
- **Clock**: `system.time.get` reads local OS clock; it does not set the clock or verify NTP synchronization.[^src-20260918-developmentguide]
- **Distance game hand placement**: Tested against unit and mock suites; hand placement timing (5–60 cm immediately at request time, before final chat response) and buzzer audibility require live physical verification. Hardware proposals (movable head, edge sensors, touch) are uninstalled concepts.[^src-20260918-developmentguide]
- **Phase 4 calendar and research**: Google Calendar requires user SSH loopback OAuth (port 8765); read-only default; write operations require `--write` and plain single-word `CONFIRM`. Preparing a create preview does not perform Google write operations; software mock gates do not guarantee Google API acceptance or handle account-level quota issues. Tavily search snippet citations provide evidence links but do not certify external factual truth.[^src-20260918-developmentguide]
- **Project help**: Runtime document section hashes ensure published section integrity, but cannot guarantee factual perfection of upstream documentation.[^src-20260918-developmentguide]
- **Model boundaries**: Rolling transcript suffix truncation preserves safety context and fits provider request character caps, but does not enforce a currency-denominated spending cap. Display font repair and physical acceptance remain open.[^src-20260918-developmentguide]
